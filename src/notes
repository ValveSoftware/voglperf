1000/average frame time = fps adjusted for average frame time.

stdev(fps)  = how "flaky" the fps is, good measure of whether or not the game runs "well/stable"
stdev (frame times) = same as aboveish, engine efficiency.  


todo:

remove 2 lines @ start of log (pulseaudio?? x64 )
 mitigate the -nan value for fps @ start, maybe trim first 3 lines? 

add hwinfo @ end of log for automated report/testing for easy reposting/sharing. 

possibly auto parse logs? 

min/max/avg/stdev for frametime * fps.

logfiles go to home instead of tmp/ or allow user specify.
